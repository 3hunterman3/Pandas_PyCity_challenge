# Pandas_PyCity_challenge

### Overview

Overview of the school district analysis:
- The idea of this analysis was to be able to find the overall passing percentages of students in the data list. We also need to be able to use different tools in the pandas library to be able to sort data and organize data that I want to see. 

### Results

How is the district summary affected?
- After looking at the district summary there was no change.

How is the school summary affected?
- The passing percentage for Thomas High School in PyCitySchools changes the overall passing percentage by 0.3%. 

How does replacing the ninth graders’ math and reading scores affect Thomas High School’s performance relative to the other schools?
- In the entire data set it does not change the reading scores or math scores. The reason for taking out the 9th graders scores was to see if the school was not including some 9th graders scores to raise their average. However, looking at the results it was very similar with or without their data meaning no information was being manipulated.  

How does replacing the ninth-grade scores affect the following:
- The only difference was the fact that the scores for the 9th graders who attended Thomas High School become NaN.

Math and reading scores by grade
- for 9th graders the scores are replaced with NaNs but for the other data it is the same.

Scores by school spending
- The numbers are almost the same since the 9th graders are no longer a factor in my data set.

Scores by school size
- The Overall Passing Percentage does not change

Scores by school type
- The scores by the school type does not alter our data.

### Conclusion
In the end we can say replacing the scores of the 9th graders there is nothing suspicious that can be seen from our data set. In the end the values that are replaced with NaN's did not change much of our data to be concerned.
